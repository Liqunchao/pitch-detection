# pitch-detection algorithms implemented
implement MPM pitch detection algorithm. Please see the .m file which contains necessary documentation and explaination of how to use.
You can use the several violin files in this folder to test this algorithm.
Note that MPM algorithm can run in real-time. This implementation, however, is not yet implemented in real-time (as of Feb. 15, 2015).
